# Current State

## Verified checkpoint — 2026-10-27
- Repository: `VISSHAL-ANAND/VOICEAGENT`; branch: `main`.
- FastAPI app: `app/main.py`; typed schemas: `app/schemas.py`; synthetic property catalog: `app/catalog.py`.
- Endpoints implemented:
  - `GET /healthz`
  - `GET /api/v1/properties` with optional city filter
  - `GET /api/v1/properties/{property_id}`
  - `GET /api/v1/demo/availability` — deterministic synthetic capacity only
  - `POST /api/v1/demo/booking-requests` — idempotent in-memory simulation only
  - `POST /api/v1/demo/manager-handoff` — simulated answered/busy/no-answer/failure outcomes only
- Demo booking requests always return `simulated_not_reserved`; no real room is held, booked, or confirmed.
- Automated tests cover health, property listing/filtering/detail/404, demo availability, explicit non-reservation, idempotency, conflicting idempotency-key reuse, capacity failure, invalid date order, unknown-property availability, guest/date validation, and manager handoff outcomes.
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/tests.yml` is active. Run #29 for commit `d4789b132f59d4f7e01bcdca03999c5e5fc68fa5` completed successfully: 22 tests passed. One upstream deprecation warning remains in Starlette's TestClient integration with httpx.
- This is still a local prototype. No real property API, live availability, actual booking, voice integration, phone number, manager transfer, or deployment is implemented or verified.

## Confirmed requirements
Python + FastAPI; Tamil, Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu; inbound virtual number; authoritative property API for availability and confirmed bookings; manager transfer when supported; ₹0 local/mock development until explicit approval for paid services.

## Blockers
- External API schema, authentication, availability semantics, and booking/idempotency behavior are unknown.
- Voice/telephony provider capabilities and India pricing are unverified.
- Recording, transcription, retention, and production compliance decisions remain open.
- The demo request store is in memory and resets on process restart; it is not production persistence.
- Manager handoff endpoint is only a simulation; no telephony provider is configured and no real call can be transferred.

## Conversation audit cadence
Update affected Markdown after each project work unit. On the fourth user prompt in a cycle, audit every Markdown file against repository evidence, correct discrepancies, and verify the final tree. Last documented counter was 1/4 before this work; continuity across sessions may be imperfect.

## Next action
Add deeper booking simulation tests and clean configuration/error handling; then inspect current provider options and integration requirements without activating paid services. Obtain the other developer's API contract before implementing real reservations.
